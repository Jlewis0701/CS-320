How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

To ensure my code, program, or software is functional and secure, planning and defining security requirements can help me achieve this goal. 
Implement standard testing practices common in the software industry , including unit, integration, and security tests, to catch bugs and vulnerabilities early. 
Finally, making sure to regularly update software and review security protocols to guard against new threats. This incluse vulnerabilities within my code.
It is important to thouroughly inspect my code for any potential risks.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

To interpret user needs effectively, it is important to gather direct feedback through surveys and interviews. 
Analyze this information to understand critical requirements and expectations.
Then, use these insights to guide the development of your program, ensuring it aligns well with what users need and want.

How do I approach designing software?
My future goal for designing software, is to start by analyzing user needs and system requirements to understand what the software must accomplish.
Then, create a detailed system design that outlines the software architecture and how different components will interact.
Finally, I want to ensure the design is scalable and maintainable, setting a solid foundation for development and future enhancements.
